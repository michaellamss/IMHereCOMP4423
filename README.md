# IMHere for COMP4423

This is a project for building the token-based attendance checking system. We build this project for the Computer Vision course COMP 4423. Students enrolled in this course are invited to join. We're going to learn the Computer Vision by playing with it.

In this project, we are going to use the Image Processing, Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Recognition which we teach in class.
